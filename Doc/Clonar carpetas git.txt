The steps to do a sparse clone are as follows:

- mkdir <repo>
- cd <repo>
- git init
- git remote add -f origin <url>

This creates an empty repository with your remote, and fetches all objects but doesn't check them out. Then do:

- git config core.sparseCheckout true

Now you need to define which files/folders you want to actually check out. This is done by listing them in .git/info/sparse-checkout, eg:

- echo "some/dir/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
- echo "another/sub/tree" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout

Last but not least, update your empty repo with the state from the remote:

- git pull origin master
